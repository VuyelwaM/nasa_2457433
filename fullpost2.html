        <p class="post-text">This is a critique of the overview of data visualization chapter by Qi Li written in the year 2020 from the book Embodying Data. This chapter intends to define data visualization, explore the concept of data visualization, depict the difference between data and Information, dive into the sub-fields of data visualization namely information and scientific visualization, evaluate the forms of data visualization, characterize data visualization, and lastly study the human perception and perpetual process of the human visual system to data visualization. I will probe into some of these topics to observe and share my thoughts. 
            Data visualization is one of the different ways to represent processed information. Over time the prevalence of data visualization improved from written visual data to digital printed data generated by computer tools. The rate of growth of visual data is quite impressive.
            In this chapter, the definition of data visualization is interpreted by a few scholars namely Card, Mackinlay, and Schneiderman (1999) say that it is the use of computer-aided technology programmed to present raw data in a way that the brain will be able to comprehend. Manovich (2010) states that it is the transformation of numerical data into visual data. In 2012, Kirk had a similar definition to that of Card and Mackinlay conveying that data visualization is the use of visual elements and techniques to make data more comprehensible and impactful to our human minds. These definitions are more or less the same, and I would think that this chapter made use of all these definitions, so we understand that visual representation is the key element to these definitions whether coming from a mathematical or literary perspective.
            Data visualization has improved over the years and in modern times programming tools have made visual data more than just visual representation but exploring, visualizing, and analyzing data. To explore this further, I will use the JavaScript library tool D3 by Observable as an example to delve into how modern visual representation is defined in the chapter and the four aspects data visualization involves. To give context, D3 is a free, open-source JavaScript library for visualizing data with hundreds of examples of visual data, for this essay I chose to use the bar chart race, this chart animates the value in millions of the top global brands from 2000 to 2019 all around the world. You can find the full example on https://observablehq.com/@d3/bar-chart-race . The dynamic race bar chart implemented in D3 exemplifies the effective utilization of real-time interaction, on-the-fly processing, visual scalability, and user assistance and personalization in data visualization. The chart responds to users' actions through play and pause buttons and adjustable sliders, enabling them to control the animation speed and engage actively with the data. Furthermore, the chart simulates on-the-fly processing by updating the bar heights dynamically as the animation progresses, effectively conveying the changes in the value of the top brand from the year 2000 to 2019 over time in a seamless manner. Its ability to handle varying numbers of brands and value of money without compromising clarity showcases its visual scalability, ensuring an informative and comprehensible representation even with large datasets. The chart does not offer user assistance and personalization features that would have enabled users to customize and explore the data according to their specific needs and preferences, but if you can go through other examples on the site, you will see that many of these visual representations have it. This tool fosters a more tailored and meaningful exploration of the dominating brands and their worth of the 19 years since 2000.
            The chapter describes the concept of data visualization as a way to investigate the world and also to record historical events(Li, 2020) dating back from the 2nd century AD to now, this statement is true because when I   go down memory lane to when I was still in primary and high school we used data visualization to study about land or areas in danger of natural disasters like fire or floods using maps in geography, charts to tabulate and equalize amounts in accounting and used volume to determine equations in math and science. And these are some of the forms of data visualizations that I will get into shortly. Data visualization has become an important part of research in many fields including algorithms, human perception, animation, computer vision, etc. (Li, 2020) 
            In the chapter, we learn of two different types of data, information, and scientific visualization. Information visualization is common in our everyday use and it comes in forms like timetables, graphs, maps etc. In the past ten years, the information visualization field has experienced rapid growth. Information design is regarded as being "about the selection, organization, and presentation of information to a given audience". Information design's primary goal is to create an effective means of communicating information, therefore the visual representation of the material must be precise and objective. It tries to provide all the necessary objective data so that users may make a decision (Li Qi, cited in Wildbur & Burke, 1998).
            The types of data used in scientific visualization In order to gain insight into a phenomenon, data is typically investigated, manipulated, and displayed as simulations, waveforms, or volumes in the context of visualization. Because scientific data can have a variety of dimensions, 3D modeling is frequently used in scientific visualization (Li Qi, cited in Ware, 2012). There are numerous varieties of scientific visualization forms.
            Data visualization proves to me that humans feast on Information with their eyes before they can make sense of what is being represented to them, the ability of our brains to define certain objects, and colors and differentiate between entities is what enables this distinction. And it is what the last part of this book covers, pre-attentive processing, the human brain's quick and automatic recognition of specific visual patterns and characteristics before the viewer is even aware of them. Li Qi, cited in  Healey (2007) investigates four theories of pre-attentive processing, the automatic detection of fundamental visual elements is how the Feature Integration Theory (FIT) explains pre-attentive processing, but its application is restricted to straightforward visual search tasks. In order to aid texture discrimination, texton theory focuses on finding textons. The Similarity Theory investigates the relationship between search time and feature-based searches. The more complete model of visual search offered by guided search theory, which combines parallel and serial processing steps, is still being studied in some areas. Guided Search Theory shows promise for difficult visual tasks, whereas FIT and Texton Theory offer essential insights. For a more comprehensive understanding of pre-attentive processing, research is required to integrate the strengths of different ideas. <br>
