            This critique will provide an in-depth description, user interface, and user experience of the website Float by Vuyelwa Mabaso. Here is the link to the website to follow along with the points that I will make, (https://vuyelwam.github.io/data-visulisation-assignment-1/). The essay is built upon design principles that are widely acknowledged and accepted within the field. and is backed up by information from academic works and books on UI and UX research. The analysis reveals the UI and UX of the website's strengths and flaws and offers helpful suggestions for enhancement. This criticism seeks to assist in improving the website's UI and UX for a more user-centered and effective online presence by assessing the alignment between design aspects and user expectations.

            <u>Introduction</u> <br>
            Float is a website with the objective of presenting data collected from NASAs application program interface, such as the updated pictures of the day from space and daily weather. Float does portray some moderate user interface, but it does not allow for some good user experience mainly because of its navigation aspect. With all the readings about making life easy for users and making things clear, a well-crafted UI and UX design is not merely about aesthetics which Float seemed to have its most focus on but it's a journey that aligns with users' expectations and enhances their engagement. It's about more than just presenting data, it's about seamlessly guiding users through content and ensuring their experience is as enriching as the information itself. 
            In this essay, I aim to thoroughly criticize Float's UI and UX design, highlight its flaws, and provide concrete ideas for improvement. I hope to contribute to the evolution of Float's digital presence into a website that connects more intimately with its users by critically examining the alignment between design principles and user expectations. 
            In the non-academic source, the YouTube channel "The Architect" provides an insightful video titled "Everything about Navigations." This video effectively breaks down the significance of website navigation for those intrigued by UI and UX but without a programming background.
            
            When we talk about navigation in terms of user experience, we're referring to how users can smoothly move from one webpage to another using the links provided. Think of pages like 'About,' 'Blog,' 'Reviews,' and 'Contact' – they're all part of this navigation. 
            
            However, putting this into practice can get tricky, as we see in the case of Float. While its navigation bars are visible and functional on the first page, they hit a snag as users move to other pages. This happens due to underlying design issues that affect the functionality of these bars. Consequently, users end up having to go back to the home page to access other pages. This not only causes frustration but also misleads users who see these navigation options that just don't work.
            
            Beyond functionality, the visibility of navigation bars is equally important. It's a way to avoid the tiresome scrolling up and down, something not recommended, especially on content-heavy pages. Float faces a dual challenge here. Besides the functional glitch, the visibility of its navigation bars suffers. Their color blends with the background of the pages they're on, making them practically invisible. What's more, the layout of Float's pages compounds the problem the proximity of sections diminishes the sense that users are moving between different pages.
            When diving into the world of user interface and experience, it's essential to give due attention to crucial elements like color schemes, typography, layout, and visual hierarchy. Sometimes, the power of color placement can be underestimated, but it holds a significant role on websites. It's crucial to adapt these aspects to the specific context of your website. For instance, a vibrant portfolio might embrace a playful array of colors, while a law firm's website would lean towards a more professional and  palette. Similarly, for online museums and art galleries, a restrained color approach avoids detracting from the displayed artworks (Wijaya et al, 2021).
            
            Float, in this regard, excels notably in its choice of color scheme. Given its association with NASA and the cosmos, Float elegantly integrates various shades of blue. These hues, in conjunction with the parallax effect, effectively convey the sensation of floating and moving through space. Additionally, Float maintains a consistent font style and size for different topics, lending a cohesive feel to the design.
            
            However, it's crucial to critically assess the layout. Echoing the navigation concerns we touched upon earlier, the presentation of pages appears somewhat cluttered, lacking clear divisions between pages. This layout style might overwhelm users by presenting a deluge of information all at once. Another notable observation pertains to an image under the 'Design' section. This image lacks contextual markers – is it a wireframe or a simple image? The omission of a heading compounds the confusion regarding its purpose. 
            "Every problem is a gift—without problems, we would not grow." - Anthony Robbins. In as much Float suffered more criticism than compliments this time around, I do see a lot of potential for development and better user interface and experience.  I will implement the following changes, instead of all pages in ul (unordered list) instead of a navigation bar, this will not only solve the issue of overwhelming the user but also give each page the allowance to clearly state its case therefore also solving the obstacle of having disorderly layout.
            To conclude, the perspective put forth by M. Hassenzahl and N. Tractinsky in their work "User experience: a research agenda" expands upon the notion of user interface and user experience. Their viewpoint emphasizes that UX goes beyond merely meeting technical requirements. Instead, it recognizes UX as a multidimensional encounter, subjective and influenced by context. This intricate interaction unfolds within a user's inner state encompassing preferences, expectations, needs, motivations, and mood – as it intertwines with the attributes of the designed system, like complexity, usability, and purpose.
